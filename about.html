<h1> About </h1>
<p>My name is Joseph Bell. I am a Software Developer with a bachelors in Computer Science from Christpoher Newport University. 
    My skills include several software development languages such as Java, C++, and Python. 
    I am also skilled in using tools such as SQL, Git, AWS, and several IDEs such such as IntelliJ and Eclipse.

During my time at Christopher Newport University, I led a kickboxing club and completed a large course load of computer science related material that equiped me 
with several sought after skills and developed my analytical thinking for complex computation problems. Some of these classes included Applied Artificial
Intelligence, Android Mobile Computing, Design Patters, Database Management Systems, and Operating Systems.

Prior to graduation, I spent 8 years working in park operations at Water Country USA. I began when I was a teenager working as a lifeguard 
and eventually climbed to highest ranking part-time position of Park Operations Supervisor. I also gained certifications in C.P.R., Water Safety Instructor,
Red Cross lifeguard instructor, A.E.D. operator, and Red Cross C.P.R. and A.E.D. instructor

After graduation, I worked as an Associate Developer with Kinsale Insurance in Richmond, VA. where I further honed my skills as a software
developer. I worked with an experienced team of developers, business analysts, product owners, and quality assurance testers. I also gained
further experience with Java, Angular, Git, AWS, and several other enterpise level development tools. 

Outside of work, I train and teach martial arts at Butokukan Karate in Williamsburg, VA. I have competed in the Virginia AAU karate tournament, trained with the Olympic bronze medalist
 Ariel Toress, and held the title of CNU kickboxing club champion for 2 semesters. 
Martial arts has also given further developed my leadership skills, as I have taught dozens of CNU students at kickboxing club as well

<h1> About </h1>
<p>My name is Joseph Bell. I am a Software Developer with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science from Christpoher Newport University and an

    <li>AWS</li>
    <li>Git</li>
</ul>

<p>While studying at Christopher Newport University, I completed a large course load of computer science related material that equiped me 
with several sought after skills and developed my analytical thinking for complex computation problems. </p>
<p>I also participated in the ICPC coding competition with the CNU ACM club and helped lead the kickboxing club</p>

Prior to graduation, I spent 8 years working in park operations at Water Country USA. I began when I was a teenager working as a lifeguard 
and eventually climbed to highest ranking part-time position of Park Operations Supervisor. I also gained certifications in C.P.R., Water Safety Instructor,
Red Cross lifeguard instructor, A.E.D. operator, and Red Cross C.P.R. and A.E.D. instructor

After graduation, I worked as an Associate Developer with Kinsale Insurance in Richmond, VA. where I further honed my skills as a software
developer. I worked with an experienced team of developers, business analysts, product owners, and quality assurance testers. I also gained
further experience with Java, Angular, Git, AWS, and several other enterpise level development tools. 

Outside of work, I train and teach martial arts at Butokukan Karate in Williamsburg, VA. I have competed in the Virginia AAU karate tournament, trained with the Olympic bronze medalist
 Ariel Toress, and held the title of CNU kickboxing club champion for 2 semesters. 
Martial arts has also given further developed my leadership skills, as I have taught dozens of CNU students at kickboxing club as well

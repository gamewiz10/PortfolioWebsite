<h1> About </h1>
<h2 class = "aboutName">My name is Joseph Bell.</h2>
<p>I am a Software Developer with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science from Christpoher Newport University and an 
    Associates of Science in Computer Science. </p>

<p>My skills I've learned include several software development languages, design patterns, and tools such as those listed below:</p>

        <p>While studying at Christopher Newport University, I completed a large course load of computer science related material that equiped me 
            with several sought after skills and developed my analytical thinking for complex computation problems.
            While I did learn several software development languages and tools, I also learned the importance of abstraction and individual research.
            This has been especially helpful in life when encountering difficult challenges, where the best approach is to take a step back and break down the complexity
            in a manner that works best for my own understanding. I also used this new manner of thinking in my academic clubs at CNU 
            such as the ICPC coding competition with the CNU ACM club and when leading training for the CNU kickboxing club. </p>

        <p>Prior to graduation, I spent 8 years working in park operations at Water Country USA. I began when I was a teenager working as a lifeguard for the park
        and continued to work until my senior year of college. In 2016, I was promoted to the position of Assistant Park Operations Supervisor and promoted again
        in 2018 to Park Operations Supervisor. During that time, I earned certifications in C.P.R., Water Safety Instruction,
        Red Cross lifeguard instructor, A.E.D. operator, and Red Cross C.P.R. and A.E.D. instructor. This experience greatly influenced my development in leadership
        and discipline to handle stressful and sometimes life threatening situations.</p>

        <p>After graduation, I worked as an Associate Developer with Kinsale Insurance in Richmond, VA. where I further honed my skills as a software
        developer. I worked with an experienced team of developers, business analysts, product owners, and quality assurance testers to complete
        tasks on first party applications. I gained experience with Java, Angular, Git, AWS, and several other enterpise level development tools. 
        This experience made me learn more about the importance of collaboration and independant reasearch to further myself as a software developer.</p>

        <p> Outside of work, I train and teach martial arts at Butokukan Karate and work on personal software projects that align with my passions.
        I have competed in the Virginia AAU karate tournament, trained with the Olympic bronze medalist Ariel Toress, and held the title of CNU kickboxing
        club champion for 2 semesters. Martial arts has also given me further development of my leadership skills, as I have taught dozens of CNU students
        at kickboxing club as well as dozens of student at Butokukan Karate. I also have further improved my skills as a developer by working on projects 
        such as this website and tools i've created to assist my friends in their creative pursuits.</p>
